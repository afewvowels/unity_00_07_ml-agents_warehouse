This started off with a forklift and a box and a barrier, but removing the box from the forklift after parenting it caused all sorts of Rigidbody problems so the agent's just a cube with a ball to put in the goal.

## Camera controls
* Space to change which arena is active
* Q / E to rotate the view 90 degrees

### Unsuccessful attempts at visual encoding
There are three scenes included, the SampleScene is the one with just Raycasts and the other two try to use visual sensors. I've had very limited success as evidenced by [this footage](https://gfycat.com/threadbareglisteningboa).
